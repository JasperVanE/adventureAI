Describe 10 locations on an off-planet space station collecting energy from a star shared with different species. Provide the answer in a javascript format of a function that returns JSON.
Example:
const adventureAI = () => ({
roomId: 'foyer', // the ID of the room the player starts in
rooms: [
  {
    id: 'foyer', // unique ID for this room
    name: 'The Foyer', // room name (shown when player enters the room)
    // room description (shown when player first enters the room)
    desc:  "Welcome to the **TEXT-ENGINE** demo disk! This disk is a text adventure game designed to introduce you to the features available to you in **text-engine**. Using this engine, you can make a text game of your own.",
    exits: [
      // GO NORTH command leads to the Reception Desk
      {dir: 'north', id: 'reception'},
    ],
  },
  {
    id: 'reception',
    name: 'Reception Desk',
    desc: "**BENJI** is here. I'm sure he'd be happy to tell you more about the features available in **text-engine**.",
    exits: [
      // exits with a BLOCK cannot be used, but print a message instead
      {dir: 'south', id: 'foyer'},
    ],
  },
],
});
