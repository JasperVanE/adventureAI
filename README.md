ai-adventure.py is the python code that creates a game file using a prompt to GPT-3 and from that generates images using DALL-E to acompany the locations in the game. Outputs into a img and game-disks folder created by script. 

updated_index.js is a file from https://github.com/okaybenji/text-engine changed to show the images in game. docs folder contains complete text-engine with game-disks and images created by script during development.

ai-adventure.py expects a .env file in the same folder as the script. Fill and rename env.example file.
